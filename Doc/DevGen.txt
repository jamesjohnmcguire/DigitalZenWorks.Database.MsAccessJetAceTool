	Å° Problem definition
		In developing web sites, a lot of time is spent working on menial tasks.  These tasks take little thought and are often quite routine tasks, however they take a long time.  Furthormore, it is quite easy in doing these tasks not to adhere to the 'rules' of the project, thus causing inconsistencies, bugs and additional time fixing them.

		*. Overview - description of model
			Basically, a classic MVC pattern.  However, what always confused me and made it more confusing, was it's implementation in a web context.  But by intepreting the browser as the 'controller', everything else becomes much simpler.  Like Thl, each view has it's html and absolute minimal code to support that view and then bulk of the code is in the model, which often will have typical classes
			so:
				<Page1>.aspx
					<Page1>.aspx.cs
				<Page2>.aspx
					<Page2>.aspx.cs
					.
					.
					.
				<PageN>.aspx
					<PageN>.aspx.cs
				media
					images
				include
					scripts
					styles
				Locality
				Common
					BasePage.cs
					DataBaseCore.cs
					Locality.cs
					UnitTest.cs

					<Table1>.cs
					<Table2>.cs
					.
					.
					.
					<Table1>.cs
				DB
					<Project>.sql
		*. use cases
			Initially, just 1:
				From the command line, I either fill in an xml file, or from a GUI, or with command line arguments with the project details, such as name and tables.
			Later on,
				Perhaps, customizing more to fit different 'genres' of websites.

	Pattern implementation
		After spending the last six months or so developing the prototype of a web application, I have moved onto refactoring and thus have begun looking at different patterns. The simplicity of the Page controller is obviously appealing, no brains - no headaches, but its usefulness is limited due to the event sequence. The event sequence is derived page - Page Load, Base Page - PageLoad, Derived page - overloaded method invocation via the callback. More useful is disabling the Page Load of the derived page giving the sequence Base Page - PageLoad and then the override callback. Using this sequence I can do high level security checks in the base page and then be assured that they have passed before the derived page is ever called, leaving only page specific security to deal with. This removes alot of repeated code in all pages deriving from the base, which is wanted. Another mod is the addition of a second callback, PostBack in addition to the PageLoad, thus giving a cleaner, more obvious sequence of events. Check the IsPostBack in the Base Page and then invoke the proper callback.
Issues
	To schema validate or not?
		pros
			Can use DataSets
			Gives added insurance to data file correctness
		cons
			hassle
			maybe overkill

	Debug Parameters
